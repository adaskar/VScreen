# VScreen

VScreen is a Swift application that allows you to view your connected displays or visible app windows in a separate window. This enables you to see what's happening on another screen even when you can't physically see the monitor itself.

## Overview

VScreen solves the problem of monitoring activity on secondary displays or specific application windows when you can't directly see them. Built using Swift and Xcode for macOS, it provides a convenient way to keep track of content across multiple screens or applications.

## Features

- Mirror any connected display in a resizable window
- View specific application windows in a dedicated viewer

- Adjustable refresh rates for performance balancing
- Minimal CPU/GPU usage
- User-friendly interface
